## Compatibility

- **Client Version**: 1.12 Vanilla (Original 2006 WoW)
- **Server**: Turtle WoW 1.17.2
- **Interface**: 11200
- **Language**: English
- **Lua Version**: 5.0 (WoW 1.12 compatible)

## How It Works

CriTrack uses combat log events available in the 1.12 client to monitor combat damage and healing. The addon listens for:

- `CHAT_MSG_COMBAT_SELF_HITS` - Your melee/ranged critical hits
- `CHAT_MSG_SPELL_SELF_DAMAGE` - Your spell critical hits  
- `CHAT_MSG_SPELL_SELF_BUFF` - Your critical heals
- `CHAT_MSG_COMBAT_FRIENDLY_BUFF` - Group member critical heals

When you deal a critical hit or heal that exceeds your current record, it:

1. Updates your highest crit/heal value
2. Records the spell or attack that caused the crit/heal
3. Saves the new record to your SavedVariables
4. Announces the new record with the spell/attack name in your chosen chat channel

## Technical Details

### Event Handling
The addon uses the classic 1.12 event system:
- Global `event` variable for event type
- Global `arg1`, `arg3`, `arg5` for event parameters
- `DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage()` for output

### SavedVariables
Data is stored in `CriTrackDB` with the following structure:
```lua
CriTrackDB = {
    -- Personal critical hit records
    highestCrit = 1250,                    -- Your highest crit damage
    highestCritSpell = "Fireball",         -- The spell/attack that caused it
    
    -- Settings
    announcementChannel = "SAY",           -- Current announcement channel
    debugEnabled = false,                  -- Debug mode on/off
    debugMode = "player",                  -- Debug scope: "player" or "party"
    
    -- Competition mode
    competitionMode = false,               -- Competition enabled/disabled
    competitionData = {                    -- Competition leaderboard data
        playerName = {
            critAmount = 1500,
            spellName = "Frostbolt",
            timestamp = 1234567890
        }
    },
    
    -- Healer tracking
    healerEnabled = false,                 -- Healer tracking enabled/disabled
    healerGroupMode = false,               -- Group heal tracking enabled/disabled
    healerData = {
        personalHighest = {
            amount = 800,
            spell = "Greater Heal",
            target = "Friendly"
        },
        groupHighest = {
            amount = 1200,
            spell = "Prayer of Healing",
            caster = "Priest",
            target = "Tank"
        }
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Addon Not Loading
1. Check that all files are in the correct directory
2. Verify addon is enabled at character select
3. Ensure file permissions are correct
4. Check that .toc file loads all modules in the right order

### No Critical Hits/Heals Detected
1. Enable debug mode with `/critdebug on`
2. Attack enemies or heal allies and watch for debug messages
3. Check if combat log events are firing properly
4. Verify the event parameters match expected values
5. Try `/crittest 100` or `/crithealtest 100` to test the recording system
6. Use `/critdebug player` to focus on your events only

### Healer Tracking Not Working
1. Enable healer tracking with `/critheal on`
2. Make sure you're actually landing critical heals
3. Check debug messages for heal parsing
4. Verify the combat log events are being captured
5. Use `/crithealtest` to test the heal recording system

### Competition Mode Issues
1. Enable competition mode with `/critcomp on`
2. Check if other players are in your group/party
3. Verify group members are generating combat events
4. Try manually adding entries with `/critadd`

### Commands Not Working
1. Verify slash commands are typed correctly
2. Check for conflicts with other addons
3. Try `/critdebug` to see if the addon loaded properly
4. Use `/crithelp` to see all available commands

### Module Loading Issues
1. Check that all .lua files are present
2. Verify .toc file lists all modules
3. Look for Lua errors in the chat frame
4. Try disabling other addons to check for conflicts
